# CSOC Week1

This week, we'll jump with the basics of development with three tracks -

1. Android Development
2. Web Development
3. Cross-platform Mobile Development using Flutter

Having knowledge of the previous week is necessary since Git remains highly used in this week. If you think you're weak in any of the topics, then try to revise them.

There's a basic project in each track as well to finish by the end of this week (June 13), so get your tools back in shape!

You may choose to compete in any number of tracks.
## Assignment

This week tasks will be on the basic of android development and comprises of making simple games like TIC-TAC-TOE and SUDOKU .

**Note**
- You have to choose one of them.

### [TIC-TAC-TOE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

The task that we'll be working over is to build a TIC-TAC-TOE game , a multi-player classic game where both players will have to choose between X or O .The first player to complete a diagonal, vertical or a horizontal blocks wins the game.

#### Bonus task

• Extra points will be rewarded for giving players a choice to choose between X or O .

• Extra points for making an unbeatable AI using Minimax algorithm.


### [SUDOKU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)

Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle game .The aim of the Sudoku puzzle is to put in a numerical digit from 1 through 9 in each
cell of a 9×9 grid made up of 3×3 sub-grids (called "block”), starting with various digits
given in some cells (the "givens") with the others empty; each row, column, and block
must contain only one instance of each numeral.

Complexity of the algorithm that are used in building are divided into two parts.
- One is the complexity of the algorithm to generate the complete grid. We discover the randomness of generating complete grid increases when the complexity increases, that is, the randomness higher and the complexity greater.

- Second, is the algorithm to assign numbers in grid and check for each row , column and block and declare the final result .

#### Bonus task

- Extra points will be rewarded for making EASY , MEDIUM and HARD levels .
